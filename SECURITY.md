# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I only add security updates to the latest MAJOR.MINOR version of the project. No security updates are backported to previous versions. If you
want be up to date on security patches, make sure your Podmytube image is up to date with `tyteck/podmytube:latest`

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability with the Podmytube codebase, you can disclose it responsibly by sending a summary to security@podmytube.com.
I will review the potential threat and fix it as fast as we can.

While I do not have a bounty program in place yet, we are incredibly thankful for people who take the time to share their findings with us. Whether it's a tiny bug that you've found or a security vulnerability, all reports help me to continuously improve Podmytube for everyone. Thank you!
