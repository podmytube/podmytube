                So you want to know more about it. Really ? Let's go !<br>

                The story of Podmytube bring me back during christmas 2016.<br>
                At this time I had almost ten hours commuting a week.<br>
                I was taking advantage of this time to listen my favourite media: <strong>podcasts</strong> üòç.<br>
                The problem was, I consumed a lot of them and often found myself without any to listen to.
            </p>

            <p class="py-4 leading-relaxed">
                One day I discovered that Youtube was hosting great shows too. <br>
                Shows I would have loved to listen to in podcast format.<br>
                Unfortunately there were no <strong>easy solution for youtuber</strong> to <strong>repurpose their
                    content</strong> into podcast format.<br>
                So I decided to build it. Initially, it was for me then I improved it for any youtuber who want to keep
                control on his show.
