                        I did not implement any solution to register your feed on any podcast catalog automatically. You will have to register it manually on each of them.<br>
                        Be quiet, this will occur only one time ðŸ¤—. So, if you register your feed on Itunes podcast and you talk about it on your channel your podcast will be well underway. ðŸš€

                        The quick answer :
                        <ol class="text-gray-700">
                        <li>First, you need to go to <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/">https://itunesconnect.apple.com/</a> and sign in</li>
                        <li>Once logged in click on "podcasts connect" (most to the right)</li>
                        <li>You should see a form where to paste your feed url (you can get it on the podmytube dashboard)</li>
                        <li>Submit it. Apple is making a quick check (it should be good ðŸ˜Ž).</li>
                        <li>Validate it. Apple is doing a manual validation on your feed. Usually, it takes between 24/48 hours.
