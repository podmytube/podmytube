                        I did not implement any solution to register your feed on any podcast catalog automatically. You
                        will have to register it manually on each of them.<br>
                        Be quiet, this will occur only one time ðŸ¤—. So, if you register your feed on Itunes podcast and you
                        talk about it on your channel your podcast will be well underway. ðŸš€

                        The quick answer :

                        <li>First, you need to go to <a
                                href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/">https://itunesconnect.apple.com/</a> and sign in
                        </li>
                        <li>Once logged in click on "podcasts connect" (most to the right)</li>
                        <li>You should see a form where to paste your feed url (you can get it on the podmytube dashboard)
                        </li>
                        <li>Submit it. Apple is making a quick check (it should be good ðŸ˜Ž).</li>
                        <li>Validate it. Apple is doing a manual validation on your feed. Usually, it takes between 24/48
                            hours.</li>

                        Once created, you can get the feed url of your podcast from the dashboard. <br>
                        Your feed url is something like <strong>https://podcasts.podmytube.com/...</strong>.<br>
                        Then, the easiest way to listen to it is to copy this feed url and paste it into your favorite
                        podcast app.<br>
                        Within Apple Podcast you are looking for "Add a show by URL" for example.
